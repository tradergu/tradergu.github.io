title: High Conviction Trading
permalink: /

{% capture md %}

**A structured approach to swing trading.**

Trading doesn’t need to be fast, noisy, or all-consuming.

Most trading education promotes day trading, scalping, and the idea that you need to quit your job to succeed. That approach never resonated with me.

High Conviction Trading is where I document a **calm, structured, high-timeframe approach** designed to fit into real life—without shortcuts or hype.

## What this is

This site is my:
- trading journal
- toolbox of frameworks and routines
- roadmap for building a repeatable trading process

I focus on **fewer, higher-quality setups**, clear risk management, and disciplined execution—only acting when conditions align.

I’m not here to sell you a dream.
I’m sharing what works *for me*, what doesn’t, and how I think about trading with structure and confidence.

## The approach

**Structure first**
Every trade starts with preparation. Checklists, rules, and repeatable steps matter more than predictions.

**High-timeframe focus**
I prioritize higher timeframes to reduce noise and improve decision quality.

**Selectivity over activity**
I don’t trade often. I wait for clear, high-conviction setups.

**Risk management as the edge**
Position sizing, invalidation, and downside control come before returns.

## What you’ll find here

**Journal**
Real trades, reviews, and decision-making with context.

**Toolbox**
Checklists, templates, and workflows for trading efficiently.

**Process**
A clear end-to-end view of how I prepare, execute, and review trades.

## Who this is for

- Busy professionals who don’t want to watch charts all day

## About

I’m **Gustav** (Trader Gu) — a Swedish engineer and swing trader.
I started trading in 2022 and quickly realized that most popular approaches weren’t realistic for people with full-time jobs and real responsibilities.

This site is my documented journey toward trading with patience, structure, and conviction.
