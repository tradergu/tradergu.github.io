**A documented, structured approach to Swing Trading.**

> This is not a signals service.
> There are no promises of returns.
> This site documents how I trade, manage risk, and evaluate decisions over time.
{: .prompt-info }

Most trading education promotes day trading, scalping, and the quit your job to trade full-time mentality - a high-risk approach that is neither realistic nor practical for busy professionals.

Most traders don’t fail because they lack information.
They fail because their **process doesn’t hold up when emotions, drawdowns, and real-life constraints show up**.

Overtrading, inconsistent risk, emotional decisions, and constantly changing strategies are usually symptoms — not the root cause.

High Conviction Trading focuses on **process, risk design, and long-term consistency** — supported by real trades, real data, and public accountability.

## 📊 Consistant profitable - Outperforming the market

> Results matter — but only when they are repeatable, benchmarked, and transparent.
{: .prompt-tip }

Over the past several years, my **Swing Trading portfolios have consistently outperformed the global equity index**, while operating with defined risk and a structured process.

**Performance highlights:**
- 📈 Multiple consecutive profitable years
- 🌍 Outperformance vs **MSCI ACWI (global index)** by **10%+ annually**
- 🧩 Results achieved across **multiple portfolios** (equities, options, crypto)
- 🛠 Same core process applied across different market regimes

Outperformance is measured against a passive global index using the same time periods and capital contributions.

## 🧪 The long-term 25-Year Trading Experiment (2025–2050)

Since January 2025, I’ve been running a **public, long-horizon experiment** designed to answer one difficult question honestly:

> Can a structured Swing Trading process outperform passive investing over decades?
{: .prompt-tip }

**How the experiment works:**
- Monthly capital contributions
- Active Swing Trading vs passive global index investing
- Public portfolio updates
- Full visibility into drawdowns, volatility, and mistakes

This isn’t about short-term results.
It’s about **whether the process holds up over time**.

## 🧠 The approach behind the results

**Process over outcome**
Trades are evaluated by execution quality, not P&L alone.

**High-timeframe structure**
Weekly and monthly context first. Noise reduction is intentional.

**Selective participation**
I trade infrequently. Most opportunities are ignored.

**Risk as a design choice**
Position sizing, instrument selection, and downside definition come before entries.

**Psychology through structure**
Rules and tools exist to protect decisions from emotion.

> Consistency comes from what you *don’t* trade just as much as what you do.

## 🧰 What you’ll find here

- Detailed **trade reviews** with reasoning and post-analysis
- **Market structure** and order-block studies
- Comparisons between **equity vs options expressions**
- Reflections on **psychology, bias, and over-optimization**
- Public tools and dashboards that enforce discipline

Everything here exists to support **decision-making**, not prediction.

## 🔍 Live trades & full transparency

I share my trades **entries, stop loss and exits live on X**, not as trade signals, but to document my decisions in real time.

No hindsight.
No edited charts.
No cherry-picking.

Every trade is shared **before the outcome is known**, win or lose.

> Transparency isn’t about being right — it’s about being accountable.
{: .prompt-tip }

These posts exist to show how I think about risk, structure, and execution — **not** to provide trade recommendations.
