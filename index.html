**A risk-first swing trading process for people who don’t trade full-time.**

> There are no promises of returns.
> This site documents how I trade, manage risk, and evaluate decisions over time.
{: .prompt-info }

Most trading education promotes day trading, scalping, and the “trade full-time” mentality - a high-risk approach that is neither realistic nor practical for busy professionals.

Unprofitable traders don’t fail because they lack information.
They fail because of unprofitable trading strategies, psychological pitfalls, greed, and lack of discipline.

High Conviction Swing Trading focuses on probability, structure, risk management, selectivity, supported by real trades, real data, and public accountability.

## 📊 Consistent profitability – Outperforming the market

> Results matter — but only when they are repeatable, benchmarked, and transparent.
{: .prompt-tip }

Over the past several years, my **Swing Trading portfolios have consistently outperformed the global equity index**, while operating with defined risk and a structured process.

**Performance highlights:**
- 📈 Multiple consecutive profitable years
- 🌍 Outperformance vs **MSCI ACWI (global index)** by **10%+ annually**
- 🧩 Results achieved across **multiple portfolios** (equities, options, crypto)
- 🛠 Same core process applied across different market regimes

Outperformance is measured against a passive global index using the same time periods and capital contributions.

## 🧪 The long-term 25 Year Trading Experiment (2025–2050)

Since January 2025, I’ve been running a **public, long-horizon experiment** designed to answer one difficult question:

> Can a structured Swing Trading strategy outperform passive investing over decades?
{: .prompt-tip }

**How the experiment works:**
- Monthly capital contributions
- Active Swing Trading vs passive global index investing
- Public portfolio updates
- Full visibility into drawdowns, volatility, and mistakes

This isn’t about short-term results.
It’s about **whether the strategy and process holds up over time**.

## 🧠 The approach behind the results

**Process over outcome**
Trades are evaluated by execution quality, not P&L alone.

**High-timeframe structure**
Weekly and monthly context first. Noise reduction is intentional.

**Selective participation**
I trade infrequently. Most opportunities are ignored.

**Risk as a design choice**
Position sizing for high risk and selectivity.

**Psychology through structure**
Rules and tools exist to protect decisions from emotion.

> Consistency comes from what you *don’t* trade just as much as what you do.

## 🧰 What you’ll find here

- Detailed **trade reviews** with reasoning and post-analysis
- **Market structure** and Order Block trading strategy
- Comparisons between **equity vs options trading**
- Reflections on **trading psychology**

## 🔍 Live trades & full transparency

I share my trades **entries, stop-loss and exits live on X**, not as trade signals, but to document my decisions in real time.

No hindsight.
No edited charts.
No cherry-picking.

Every trade is shared live, win or lose.

> Transparency isn’t about being right - it’s about being accountable.
{: .prompt-tip }

These posts exist to show how I think about risk, structure, and execution - **not** to provide trade recommendations.
