**A documented, structured approach to Swing Trading.**

> This is not a signals service or a promise of returns.
> It is a transparent record of how I trade, manage risk, and evaluate performance over time.
{: .prompt-info }

Most trading content focuses on speed, certainty, and short-term outcomes.

High Conviction Trading focuses on **process, risk design, and long-term consistency** — supported by real trades, real data, and public accountability.

## 📊 Proven performance (with context)

> Results matter — but only when they are repeatable, benchmarked, and transparent.
{: .prompt-tip }

Over the past several years, my **Swing Trading portfolios have consistently outperformed the global equity index**, while operating with defined risk and a structured process.

**Performance highlights:**
- 📈 Multiple consecutive profitable years
- 🌍 Outperformance vs **MSCI ACWI (global index)** by **10%+ annually**
- 🧩 Results achieved across **multiple portfolios** (equities, options, crypto)
- 🛠 Same core process applied across different market regimes

Outperformance is measured against a passive global index using the same time periods and capital contributions.

## 🧪 The long-term experiment

### The 25-Year Trading Experiment (2025–2050)

Since January 2025, I’ve been running a **public, long-horizon experiment** designed to answer one difficult question honestly:

> Can a structured Swing Trading process outperform passive investing over decades?
{: .prompt-tip }

**How the experiment works:**
- Monthly capital contributions
- Active Swing Trading vs passive global index investing
- Public portfolio updates
- Full visibility into drawdowns, volatility, and mistakes

This experiment exists to test **process durability**, not short-term performance.

## 🧠 The approach behind the results

**Process over outcome**
Trades are evaluated by execution quality, not P&L alone.

**High-timeframe structure**
Weekly and monthly context first. Noise reduction is intentional.

**Selective participation**
I trade infrequently. Most opportunities are ignored.

**Risk as a design choice**
Position sizing, instrument selection, and downside definition come before entries.

**Psychology through structure**
Rules and tools exist to protect decisions from emotion.

> Consistency comes from what you *don’t* trade just as much as what you do.

## 🧰 What you’ll find here

- Detailed **trade reviews** with reasoning and post-analysis
- **Market structure** and order-block studies
- Comparisons between **equity vs options expressions**
- Reflections on **psychology, bias, and over-optimization**

Everything here exists to support **decision-making**, not prediction.
