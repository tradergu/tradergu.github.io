## High Conviction Trading

**A structured approach to swing trading.**

> Trading doesn’t need to be fast, noisy, or all-consuming.
> This is a calmer, high-timeframe process built for real life.
{: .prompt-info }

Most trading education promotes day trading, scalping, and the “quit your job to trade full-time” mentality. That approach never resonated with me.

High Conviction Trading is where I document a **structured, repeatable approach** centered on:
- patience and preparation
- selective execution
- non-negotiable risk management

## About

I’m **Gustav** (Trader Gu) — a Swedish engineer and swing trader. I started trading in 2022 and quickly realized most popular approaches weren’t practical for people with full-time lives and real responsibilities.

This site is my **journal, toolbox, and roadmap**—documenting what works for me, what doesn’t, and how I approach trading with discipline and confidence.
