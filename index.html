# High Conviction Swing Trading
**Few positions. Heavy sizing. Full transparency.**

---

## This Is Not a Trading Signal Site

Most trading content is built around speed, noise, and constant action.
This site is the opposite.

**High Conviction Swing Trading** documents a long-term, process-driven approach to markets—focused on **quality over quantity**, **risk over prediction**, and **execution over ego**.

No hype.
No indicators for the sake of complexity.
No pretending losses don’t exist.

Just real trades, real risk, and real accountability.

---

## Who This Is For

This site is for you if:

- You prefer **weekly and monthly timeframes** over intraday noise
- You value **clarity and patience** more than constant activity
- You want a trading system that **fits around a real life and career**
- You care more about **process consistency** than being right
- You understand that drawdowns are part of the game—not a failure

If you’re looking for alerts, fast money, or guaranteed outcomes—this isn’t it.

## My Trading Philosophy

I trade **high-timeframe swing setups** built around clearly defined **Areas of Interest**, primarily using **order blocks** and market structure.

Every trade must answer three questions **before** risk is deployed:

1. **Where is institutional interest likely to exist?**
2. **What invalidates the idea?**
3. **Is the risk worth the opportunity?**

If the answer isn’t obvious, the trade isn’t taken.

> I’m not here to be right.
> I’m here to be profitable.

## How I Trade

- **Few positions** — only the highest-conviction setups
- **Heavy sizing** — when the setup deserves it
- **Defined risk** — every trade has a clear invalidation
- **Long holding periods** — weeks to months, not minutes
- **Minimal screen time** — analysis is done in advance

Most trades are planned in advance and executed calmly—often from a phone.

## About Me

I’m Gustav—engineer, entrepreneur, and swing trader.

I trade markets **alongside a full life**, not instead of one.
This site is both a personal trading journal and a public experiment in long-term discipline.

Nothing here is financial advice.
Everything here is real.

## Start Here

If you’re new, I recommend starting with:

- A trade review to see how ideas are executed
- An order-block article to understand the framework
- A psychology post to understand how I think under pressure

Then decide for yourself whether this approach resonates.

---

## Final Thought

Trading doesn’t need to be loud to be effective.

Sometimes the most powerful edge is doing **less**, but doing it **better**—consistently, patiently, and with conviction.

Welcome.
