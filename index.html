## High Conviction Trading

**A documented, structured approach to swing trading.**

> This is not a signals service, a course, or a promise of returns.
> It is a public record of how I think, prepare, execute, and review trades over time.
{: .prompt-info }

Most trading content focuses on speed, certainty, and outcomes.

My work focuses on something else:
**decision-making under uncertainty**, backed by structure, risk control, and long-term accountability.

## What this site is

High Conviction Trading is where I document:
- how I build conviction *before* entering a trade
- how I define and contain risk
- how I choose between equity and options
- how I review trades without outcome bias
- how I stay consistent across winning and losing periods

This includes real trades, real numbers, and real mistakes.

> The goal is not to be right on every trade.
> The goal is to execute a sound process repeatedly.

## The long-term experiment

### The 25-Year Trading Experiment (2025–2050)

Since January 2025, I’ve been running a public, long-term experiment:

- Monthly capital contributions
- Active swing trading vs passive global index investing
- Fully transparent portfolio updates
- Documented wins, losses, and drawdowns

> This experiment exists to answer one question honestly:
> Can a structured trading process outperform passive investing over decades?
{: .prompt-info }

Performance, volatility, and mistakes are all shared publicly.

## The approach

**Process over outcome**
Trades are evaluated by execution quality, not profit alone.

**High-timeframe structure**
I focus on weekly and monthly contexts to reduce noise.

**Selective participation**
I trade infrequently and only when conditions align.

**Risk as a design choice**
Position sizing, stop placement, and instrument choice matter more than entries.

**Psychology through structure**
Rules and tools exist to protect decisions from emotion.

> Not every loss contains a lesson.
> Over-optimization is often more dangerous than randomness.

## Tools, not promises

You’ll find:
- Detailed trade reviews
- Market structure and order-block analysis
- Comparisons between equity and option expressions
- Psychology and mindset reflections
- Public dashboards and templates

Everything here exists to **support execution**, not prediction.
