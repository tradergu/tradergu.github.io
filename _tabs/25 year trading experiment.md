## 25 Year Trading Experiment  
In January 2025, I launched an ambitious long-term challenge: to actively trade against a global index benchmark over 25 years. The structure is simple:

Every month, I invest 10,000 SEK (~$1,000), split evenly between:  
- 🌍 A **passive portfolio** - invested in [Storebrand Global All Countries A SEK](https://storebrandfonder.fondlista.se/details/SE0000671919/2) (tracking the MSCI ACWI Index).  
- 🌊 An **active portfolio** - where I apply my own High-conviction Trading strategies.

### The Goal:
Successfully outperform a global index over a 25 Year time period.
