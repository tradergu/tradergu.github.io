## 25-Year Trading Experiment  
In January 2025, I launched an ambitious long-term challenge: to actively trade against a global index benchmark over 25 years. The structure is simple:

Every month, I invest 10,000 SEK (~$1,000), split evenly between:  
- 🌍 A **passive portfolio** — invested in Storebrand Global All Countries A SEK (tracking the MSCI ACWI Index).  
- 🌊 An **active portfolio** — where I apply my own high-conviction trading strategies.

### The Goal:
Successfully outperform a global index over a 25-year time period.

## What This Experiment Tracks:

- 📈 Live Trades   
- 💼 Portfolio Updates  
- 🟢 Wins
