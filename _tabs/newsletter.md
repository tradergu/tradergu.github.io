## Trader Gu's Wave Report

Welcome to the **Trader Guâ€™s Wave Report** â€” a monthly breakdown of how Iâ€™m evaluating the market, step by step.

Inside, youâ€™ll find the tickers on my watchlist, the Areas of Interest (AOI) I'm looking to trade and my thought process of what to expect in order to execute.

> Trading, much like surfing, isnâ€™t about chasing every move. You sit. You scan the horizon. You wait. Then, when the right wave rolls in â€” you execute with conviction.

### Inside the report:

- ðŸ‘€ Developing setups of tickers inside my AOI
- ðŸ§² Tickers approaching key levels
- ðŸ”­ High timeframe moves for long-term preparation
- ðŸŒ• Monthly bonus chart

This Wave Report exists to help me - and hopefully you - **stay focused on the few, high-conviction setups** that matter.
