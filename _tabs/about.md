👋 Hey, I’m Gustav, also known as Trader Gu — a Swedish engineer and part-time trader who believes that trading should **fit into your life - not the other way around**. I started trading in 2022 and quickly realized that most trading education promotes day trading, scalping, and the ‘quit your job to trade full-time’ mentality — a high-risk approach that is neither realistic nor practical for busy professionals.

That approach didn’t resonate with me.

Instead, I developed a structured, high-timeframe trading strategy that allows me to trade efficiently while balancing a full-time job. My focus is on high-conviction setups, proper risk management, and executing only when the right conditions align​📍 

This space is my trading journal, toolbox, and roadmap, where I document my journey with real trades, market insights, and lessons learned.

I’m not here to sell you a dream - just sharing what works **for me**, what doesn’t, and how to approach trading with discipline and confidence.
