Welcome to the **Trader Guâ€™s Wave Report** â€” a monthly breakdown of how Iâ€™m evaluating the market, step by step.

Inside, youâ€™ll find the tickers on my watchlist, the Areas of Interest (AOI) I'm looking to trade and my thought process of what to expect in order to execute.

> Trading, much like surfing, isnâ€™t about chasing every move. You sit. You scan the horizon. You wait. Then, when the right wave rolls in â€” you execute with conviction.
