Time for another portfolio update - this time covering both my __Private Trading Account__ and __Company Trading Account__.
While I use the same strategy across both accounts, there are times when I can't enter identical trades due to capital constraints, allocation differences, or time limitations. This means each portfolio develops slightly differently, but the core trading philosophy remains unchanged.


## Trader Gu - Private Account
The private account currently consists of five trades—three high-conviction trades and two aggressive entries. I plan to review the aggressive entries early next week to decide whether to keep or exit them.

Overall, portfolio risk is well-balanced, and with an additional capital injection at the start of February, I’m still considering how to allocate it efficiently into new positions.

🗓 Year-to-date P&L: +15%
📊 Number of positions: 5
💰 Top Holding: $BABA (31.6%)
⚠ Total Portfolio Risk: 30%

> The year-to-date performance would be >25% if I hadn’t added a large chunk of capital at the beginning of February, which reduced the percentage gain overall.

## Trader Gu - Company Account
The company account holds mostly the same positions as the private account, but with some differences:

No $CRSP position (for now)
Recently took some profit on $BABA to reduce exposure
Both accounts follow a risk-on-invested-capital model, but since I haven’t injected additional capital into the company account, the risk model has limitations. This is something I’ll be refining as part of my Trading Goals for 2025.

🗓 Year-to-date P&L: +25%
📊 Number of positions: 5
💰 Top Holding: $BABA (38.6%)
⚠ Total Portfolio Risk: 32%

## 📈 Portfolio Performance: Yearly Progress
Both portfolios are off to a strong start in 2025, but the performance since October 2023 has been incredibly strong—beyond my expectations.

* Private Account: Nearly 100% cumulative return since inception, but with February’s capital injection, adjusted to 50%.
* Company Account: 85% total unrealized profit since inception (no additional capital injected).

## 🔍 Looking Ahead
I’m thrilled that my main trades are finally breaking out toward my target levels. Over the coming weeks, I hope to take profits and reallocate into new positions in line with my strategy. 2025 has already brought great volatility, and I hope this trend continues in my favor throughout the year.

I see many opportunities brewing in the market, and I might start a new series for market screening to share what I'm planning for. I don't take many trades per year but the ones I do need planning weeks or months in advance of entering.
