I am a strong believer in positive thinking and continuous personal and professional improvement. Starting this blog was a step toward that journey, and I firmly believe in setting clear, measurable short- and long-term goals. While long-term goals help me visualize what kind of trader I want to be, itâ€™s the short-term habits that drive me toward those goals.
Every day, I begin with a personal affirmation that reminds me of who I am and what I do. It literally takes 1 minute ðŸ˜†.

When it comes to trading, my affirmation is:
> I am a consistently profitable Forex day trader and Equity Swing Trader.

> I'm not here to be right. I'm here to be profitable.
