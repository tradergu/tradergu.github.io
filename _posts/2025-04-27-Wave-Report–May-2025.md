Let’s dive into what’s shaping up for May 👇

## 👀 Developing Trades - Inside my Area of Interest (AOI)

### $TSLA – Ready for a big move!
Tesla was featured in the April Wave Report, and we've seen a huge move to the downside and back.  
Despite some volatility, we’re still respecting the monthly order block — although we came close to invalidating it. Price briefly dipped just below it, but most importantly, we've now confirmed a weekly bullish market structure with Friday’s close.

This signals a high probability of moving higher. That said, I’m expecting a retracement back toward the preferred entry around $262, where the new weekly order block has formed.

### $AMD – Waiting for a high-conviction trigger
AMD has seen a 66% move to the downside after making its all-time high at $227 at the start of 2024.  
Recently, we had a strong push downward, which invalidated a previous monthly order block. For now, we’re seeing a strong reaction from the $76 order block — an area that could offer an interesting setup for me.

A weekly close above **$109** would confirm a bullish market structure shift on the weekly timeframe.  
For now, we’re still in a bearish weekly trend, but if we close above **$110**, it would clearly confirm the structure shift to the upside.

If this doesn’t happen, I could see AMD continuing lower toward the COVID lows around **$40**.  
That said, I'm interested in a setup from the current level — but only with the right confirmation.

## 🧲 Approaching my Area of Interest (AOI)

### $JD – Monthly retracement for the next leg higher
Jindong ($JD) has been building a steady bullish market structure since May 2024.  
I’m looking to enter a trade around the monthly order block at $31–$30, which we haven’t tapped yet but moving towards.

Overall, I am bullish on $JD until we reach the monthly bearish order block at $55–$58, where I would look to take profit at high-timeframe resistance.

### $CMG – Moving to the Order Block or Missing the Ride?
Chipotle ($CMG) has been a beast over the past few years, and I've been watching for an entry for years. We recently barely tapped the monthly order block, so this could either be a missed ride - or we might see a move back into the order block over the next few weeks, potentially developing a weekly market structure shift that would set up a strong move in the months ahead.

I’m not chasing trades, but this might be one of those occasions where I just have to accept missing the move.  
Let’s see how it plays out.

## 🔭 Long-Term Watchlist

These are tickers I’m monitoring on the **monthly or higher timeframes** for future setups.
### $WHR – Move to Covid Low?
Whirlpool $WHR has been on a steady downtrend since its all-time high around mid-July 2021, and so far, there are no signs of a trend reversal on the higher timeframes.  
I’d be interested in looking for a trade **after** we take out the COVID low at **$64** - there's a high probability that liquidity will be swept at that level.

## 🌕 Bonus Chart

### $NOVO, aka $NVO ready to retrace?
April’s Bonus Chart is Novo Nordisk ($NOVO on the Denmark exchange, $NVO on the NYSE).  
$NOVO has been in a hefty downtrend since mid-2024, and we’ve finally taken significant liquidity around 500 DKK.  
We are now inside my area of interest - the monthly order block around 400 DKK.

A first take-profit level from this zone would be the bearish order block around 560 DKK.  
That said, this could also develop into a weekly and potentially monthly market structure shift to the upside.

## 🌊 Wave Report Follow-up
In the [April Wave Report](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Wave-Report-April-2025/), I mentioned $AAPL as part of my long-term watchlist.  
The market moved quickly into my area of interest, and I ended up opening an aggressive entry.  
The trade hit my target within just one week, adding a **2.5% realized profit** to my portfolio.  
The trade was [shared publicly on X](https://x.com/trader_gu/status/1911778557488923066), and for now, $AAPL has moved into my general watchlist.

I would’ve appreciated a clean entry trigger so I could have added more size to this trade - but overall, I’m satisfied it played out as expected and locked in solid profits.


## 💡 Final Thought: Dont let the news affect your trading

The past month has been filled with significant moves, high volatility, and a flood of content around trade wars, tariffs, and general uncertainty about where the market is heading.  
The best thing about being a technical trader?  
You don’t need to listen to any of it.

Just let the chart tell you where the highest-probability levels are - and plan accordingly.

Until next month,  
– Trader Gu
