Let’s dive into what’s shaping up for May 👇

## 👀 Developing Trades - Inside my Area of Interest (AOI)
These are potential setups building in my area of interest and the ones that I am tracking on the daily and weekly time frames for potential entries.

### $TSLA – Ready for a big move!
Tesla was featured in the April Wave Report, and we've seen a huge move to the downside and back.  
Despite some volatility, we’re still respecting the monthly order block — although we came close to invalidating it. Price briefly dipped just below it, but most importantly, we've now confirmed a weekly bullish market structure with Friday’s close.

This signals a high probability of moving higher. That said, I’m expecting a retracement back toward the preferred entry around $262, where the new weekly order block has formed.

### $AMD – Waiting for a high-conviction trigger
AMD has seen a 66% move to the downside after making its all-time high at $227 at the start of 2024.  
Recently, we had a strong push downward, which invalidated a previous monthly order block. For now, we’re seeing a strong reaction from the $76 order block — an area that could offer an interesting setup for me.

A weekly close above **$109** would confirm a bullish market structure shift on the weekly timeframe.  
For now, we’re still in a bearish weekly trend, but if we close above **$110**, it would clearly confirm the structure shift to the upside.

If this doesn’t happen, I could see AMD continuing lower toward the COVID lows around **$40**.  
That said, I'm interested in a setup from the current level — but only with the right confirmation.

## 🧲 Approaching my Area of Interest (AOI)
Tickers approaching my areas of interest often exhibit sharp, volatile reactions. Sometimes, price breaks down entirely. Other times, it begins to form a structure that can evolve into a trade over days, weeks even months.

When price reaches a high-conviction zone, I often consider aggressive entries—not because the setup is fully confirmed, but to ensure I’m positioned early at key levels while the trade thesis has time to develop.

### $JD – Monthly retracement for the next leg higher
Jindong ($JD) has been building a steady bullish market structure since May 2024.  
I’m looking to enter a trade around the monthly order block at $31–$30, which we haven’t tapped yet but moving towards.

Overall, I am bullish on $JD until we reach the monthly bearish order block at $55–$58, where I would look to take profit at high-timeframe resistance.

### $CMG – Moving to the Order Block or Missing the Ride?
Chipotle ($CMG) has been a beast over the past few years, and I've been watching for an entry for years. We recently barely tapped the monthly order block, so this could either be a missed ride - or we might see a move back into the order block over the next few weeks, potentially developing a weekly market structure shift that would set up a strong move in the months ahead.

I’m not chasing trades, but this might be one of those occasions where I just have to accept missing the move.  
Let’s see how it plays out.

## 🔭 Long-Term Watchlist
These are tickers I’m monitoring on the monthly or higher timeframes. While they may currently be far from my area of interest, I track them to stay aware of how price evolves as it approaches key levels. Monitoring on the higher timeframes allows me to prepare well in advance and be ready to position myself when trade opportunities emerge.

Long-term positions require long-term planning. That includes not just the technical setup, but also making sure I have capital available to allocate when the time is right.

### $WHR – Move to Covid Low?
Whirlpool $WHR has been on a steady downtrend since its all-time high around mid-July 2021, and so far, there are no signs of a trend reversal on the higher timeframes.  
I’d be interested in looking for a trade **after** we take out the COVID low at **$64** - there's a high probability that liquidity will be swept at that level.

## 🌕 Bonus Chart

### $NOVO, aka $NVO ready to retrace?
April’s Bonus Chart is Novo Nordisk ($NOVO on the Denmark exchange, $NVO on the NYSE).  
$NOVO has been in a hefty downtrend since mid-2024, and we’ve finally taken significant liquidity around 500 DKK.  
We are now inside my area of interest - the monthly order block around 400 DKK.

A first take-profit level from this zone would be the bearish order block around 560 DKK.  
That said, this could also develop into a weekly and potentially monthly market structure shift to the upside.

## 🌊 Wave Report Follow-up
In the [April Wave Report](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Wave-Report-April-2025/), I mentioned $AAPL as part of my long-term watchlist.  
The market moved quickly into my area of interest, and I ended up opening an aggressive entry.  
The trade hit my target within just one week, adding a **2.5% realized profit** to my portfolio.  
The trade was [shared publicly on X](https://x.com/trader_gu/status/1911778557488923066), and for now, $AAPL has moved into my general watchlist.

I would’ve appreciated a clean entry trigger so I could have added more size to this trade - but overall, I’m satisfied it played out as expected and locked in solid profits.


## 💡 Final Thought: Dont let the news affect your trading

The past month has been filled with significant moves, high volatility, and a flood of content around trade wars, tariffs, and general uncertainty about where the market is heading.  
The best thing about being a technical trader?  
You don’t need to listen to any of it.

Just let the chart tell you where the highest-probability levels are - and plan accordingly.

Until next month,  
– Trader Gu
