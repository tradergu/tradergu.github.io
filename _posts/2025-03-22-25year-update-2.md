It's been two months since launching the [25 Year Trading Experiment](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/), and I decided to make a short post about the portfolio performance so far. While I don't plan to publish monthly updates regularly, last month showed a solid positive return, and this month is in a drawdown. So I felt it was the right time to highlight both sides of the journey. All trades are shared live on [x.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu) and can be tracked via my [public trading dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCsMDJjEhU-OZyRrSXDfPYIgLufIaJ6GOod4ubMTBbI/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0).

## Active vs Passive Portfolio
The actively managed portfolio has outperformed the benchmark by 6 percentage points and the performance on a monthly basis is:

* Trader Gu: Currently down 11% (unrealized loss)
* Global Index: also down, by a whopping -8.4%

Although I was up [17% in the first month](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25year-update-1/), I've since doubled the capital in the account, and despite a strong start, the portfolio is now in an overall drawdown.

## Trades Taken
I am currently in two trades. One for Tesla and one for Crispr Therapeutics.

### The $TSLA Trade (ongoing)
 The Tesla trade was an aggressive entry where I had anticipated a strong reaction from a monthly order block. typically for aggressive entries I use a wider stop loss and I am anticipating that there will be a trade trigger developed over the coming weeks. Sometimes that pays off with a good entry, sometimes it does not. This was one of those times where it was no reaction at all, and there was an aggressive sell-off on the price. It will be very interesting to see how Tesla develops in the the coming weeks and months. 
### Trade Entry
ðŸ“Œ Entry: $269.91 
â›” SL: $138.8 
ðŸ§² Target: $373

### The $CRSP Trade (ongoing)
The $CRSP trade was a high-conviction setup based on a weekly bullish market structure. I entered on the retracement back to the weekly order block, after the daily chart confirmed a bullish market structure shift. I initially hoped for a slightly better entry but chose not to be greedy and executed the trade at $58.38.

So far, price hasnâ€™t reacted as impulsively as I anticipated and has started drifting lower. Given the new current bearish structure on the daily, the probability of this trade playing out successfully has likely decreased. That said, Iâ€™m still glad I took the setupâ€”it aligned with my process, and Iâ€™m comfortable holding the position for now. Time will tell.
### Trade Execution
ðŸ“Œ Entry: 58.38  
â›” SL: 38  
ðŸ§² Target: 78.46

## Portfolio Update Reflections
Posting trades live on X (twitter) and sharing updates on this blog is definitely something traders should reflect on. Because it may or may not impact your trading mindset and performance. For me, I'm still figuring this out and time will tell. But I do have a small suspicion that publicly posting could increase the tendency to overtrade - something that I would need to stay mindful of and actively work on going forward. 

That said, I generally enjoy the process of preparing my posts, and articles, as well journaling about my trades. Keeping things public has also been surprisingly fulfilling - it creates opportunities to connect with like-minded traders, have conversations that matter, and I feel I'm growing both as a person and as a trader by doing so. 


## Summary
Two months into the 25 Year Trading Experiment, the portfolio is currently in a drawdown, and Iâ€™m looking forward to adding more capital as planned first thing Monday. The actively traded account is currently sitting at an unrealized loss of -3.4%, while the passive global index benchmark is also under pressure, down -9.3%. While short-term comparisons arenâ€™t the main focus of this experiment, the active portfolio has still outperformed the index by roughly 6 percentage points so far.

Are you working on a similar project or perhaps have position on either $CRSP or $TSLA? Drop a comment - Iâ€™d love to hear what your working on.ðŸ‘‡
