Next up in my chart analysis series is **$HIMS – Hims & Hers Health, Inc.**, which saw a significant 🔴 **-30% drop** following the news that **$NOVO – Novo Nordisk** is [terminating its collaboration](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-terminates-collaboration-with-hims--hers-health-inc-due-to-concerns-about-their-illegal-mass-compounding-and-deceptive-marketing-302488189.html).  

Novo cited concerns about “illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing.” Strong words.  

Let’s take a look at the technicals — top-down analysis inside the video:
