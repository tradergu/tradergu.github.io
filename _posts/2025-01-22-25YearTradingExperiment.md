As we enter 2025, I’m embarking on a new experiment—tracking my performance against the market with a fresh portfolio. My goal is to consistently outperform a global index fund over an extended period using my own trading strategies.

I’ll be investing 10,000 SEK (~ $1000) monthly, equally split into two accounts, with contributions made on the 22nd of each month:

* <b>A passive account</b>, invested in [Storebrand Global All Countries A SEK](https://www.nordnet.se/fonder/lista/storebrand-global-all-countries-sek-fdd6454b), a Global Index Fund that follows the [MSCI ACWI Index](https://www.msci.com/indexes/index/892400), serving as my benchmark.
* <b>An active trading</b> account, where I’ll apply my strategies to hopefully outperform my benchmark.

This experiment is an exciting opportunity to track both my financial performance and personal growth over time. This is the most objective way to measure performance—directly comparing my results against the market with clear, tangible data. Although I'm confident in my trading performance, I remain humble—some years may not perform as well as others, as certain trades take longer to develop, and even the best traders go through phases of drawdowns and market uncertainty. For example, in 2024, my main trading portfolio achieved a yearly return of +47%, compared to my benchmark index, which ended the year at +26%, outperforming by 21 percentage points. 

Since my main trading portfolio doesn't receive regular contributions, I’m eager to see how consistent investing shapes long-term results.

I’ll be sharing monthly updates on both accounts—breaking down performance, key trades, and insights along the way.  

By keeping this journey public, I hope to inspire and engage others on their own trading paths. Like many traders, I've had my wins and losses, but tracking this journey publicly keeps me accountable and motivated to challenge myself and grow as a trader.  

Whether your goal is to build a passive income engine or achieve financial independence through trading, let’s learn, adapt, and aim to outperform the market together.

<b>Let's go!</b> 🌊
