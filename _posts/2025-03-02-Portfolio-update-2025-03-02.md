Time for another portfolio update - this time covering both my __Private Trading Account__ and __Company Trading Account__.
While I use the same strategy across both accounts, there are times when I can't enter identical trades due to capital constraints, allocation differences, or time limitations. This means each portfolio develops slightly differently, but the core trading philosophy remains unchanged.


## Trader Gu - Private Account
The private account currently consists of seven trades—four high-conviction trades and three aggressive entries. I plan to review the aggressive entries early next week to decide whether to keep or exit them.

Overall, portfolio risk is well-balanced, and with an additional capital injection at the start of February, I’m still considering how to allocate it efficiently into new positions.

🗓 Year-to-date P&L: +15%  
📊 Number of positions: 7  
💰 Top Holding: $BABA (31.6%)  
⚠ Total Portfolio Risk: 30%  

> The year-to-date performance would be >25% if I hadn’t added a large chunk of capital at the beginning of February, which reduced the percentage gain overall.

## Trader Gu - Company Account
The company account holds mostly the same positions as the private account, but with some differences:

* No $CRSP, $TSLA position (for now)
* Recently took some profit on $BABA to reduce exposure  

Both accounts follow a risk-on-invested-capital model, but since I haven’t injected additional capital into the company account, this risk model has some limitations. This is something I’ll be refining as part of my [Trading Goals for 2025](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/2025-goals/).

🗓 Year-to-date P&L: +25%  
📊 Number of positions: 5  
💰 Top Holding: $BABA (38.6%)  
⚠ Total Portfolio Risk: 32%

## 📈 Portfolio Performance: Yearly Progress
Both portfolios are off to a strong start in 2025, but the performance since October 2023 has been incredibly strong - well beyond my expectations.

* Private Account: Nearly 100% cumulative return since inception, but with February’s capital injection, adjusted to 50%.
* Company Account: 85% total unrealized profit since inception (no additional capital injected).

## 🔍 Looking Ahead
My high-conviction trades are approaching key levels, and if conditions align, I will be ready to execute my take-profit strategy as planned. 2025 has already brought strong volatility, and I will continue to manage risk and adjust positions accordingly as the market develops.

I see several opportunities forming, and I’m considering launching a market screening series to share key areas of interest, trade setups, and my entry criteria. Since I take only a few trades per year, each entry often (but not always) requires weeks or months of preparation, ensuring I act only when the right conditions are met.
