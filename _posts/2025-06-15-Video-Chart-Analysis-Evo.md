Starting off a new series of chart analysis in video format on my new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trader_gu). First off is an overview of $EVO Evolution Gaming that I've been following for several months and regularly posted on my X-Feed. Last week, my friend [Eric García](https://x.com/SuEricGP) Asked me about the recent price action in [Evolution Gaming](https://www.evolution.com/), and that inspired me to create a quick video analysis.

Thanks, Eric, for the inspiration — and for those interested in thoughtful, high-quality financial analysis, I highly recommend his account.
