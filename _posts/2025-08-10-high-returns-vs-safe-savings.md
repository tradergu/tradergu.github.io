When it comes to growing your money, there’s no escaping the eternal trade-off: **No Risk. No Reward.**  
My results this year are a live case study in how three different approaches can play out in practice.

---

## 1️⃣ Actively Traded Portfolio – **+11.4%**

For the past 200 days (~7 months), I’ve deposited **$500** each month into my actively traded account.  
Today, that account sits **+11.4% above my total contributions**.

To match that in a savings account, you’d need a whopping **42% annual interest rate**—good luck finding that at your local bank.

The catch? This return came with **volatility**. My monthly P&L has ranged from **+17.1%** to **-13.6%**. You have to stomach those swings without panic-selling and stick to your winning strategy.

## 2️⃣ Passively Invested Portfolio – **+4.2%**

Alongside active trading, I’ve also been depositing **$500 per month** into a **global index fund**.  
After the same 200 days, that portfolio is up **+4.2%**.

Lower than my trading return, yes—but still far better than a savings account.  
Volatility has been smaller than in my trading portfolio, but still noticeable for an index fund.

For context, globally diversified index funds have averaged about **+7% annually** over decades. My +4.2% in just over half a year is well on pace for that—and actually outperforming on a time-weighted basis given the monthly deposits.

---

## 3️⃣ Savings Account – **Safe but Limited**

Savings accounts are steady, predictable, and risk-free (within deposit guarantees).  
But with typical rates currently under 2% per year in Sweden, **inflation quietly erodes your purchasing power**.

They’re perfect for **emergency funds** or short-term goals—but they can’t compete with investing or trading for long-term growth.

## Risk, Reward, and Personality Fit

**Results so far:**

| Approach              | Return (7 months) | Typical Long-Term Annual Average | Effort Level | Volatility |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Active Trading**    | +11.4%            | Highly variable                  | High         | High       |
| **Passive Investing** | +4.2%             | ~7%                              | Low          | Moderate   |
| **Savings Account**   | ~0.8–2%           | ~2%                              | None         | None       |

## The Long Game

If I keep these monthly contributions going for **10 years**, here’s the math:

- **Active Trading (current pace):** ~$902,880
- **Passive Investing (current pace):** ~$87,047  
- **Savings Account (2% annual):** ~$66,470  

The gap is striking. At the same contribution rate, active trading *could* more than double passive investing’s outcome—and nearly triple savings.  

> ⚠️ Important: These figures are purely hypothetical. They assume I could maintain my current 7-month performance pace for a full decade—which is extremely unlikely in reality. Active trading returns can vary dramatically year to year, and there will almost certainly be losing periods along the way. This projection is for illustration purposes only.

This is exactly why I started the [25-Year Trading Experiment](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/)—to see the compounding effect of active trading vs. passive investing over decades, with all the ups and downs included.

## 📈 Hypothetical 10-Year Portfolio Growth Projection

![Portfolio Growth Comparison](/assets/img/2025/August/portfoliocomparisonchart.svg)

*Assumes current 7-month average returns for active trading and passive investing, with monthly $500 deposits. Past performance ≠ future results. Projections are for illustrative purposes only and are not a guarantee of future returns.*

## Final Thoughts

There’s no one-size-fits-all. It depends on your **goals**, **time horizon**, and **personality**.

- **Active trading**: higher potential returns, but requires a profitable trading strategy, discipline, and emotional resilience.  
- **Passive investing**: a balanced growth path with minimal effort—historically beating most active traders over the long term.  
- **Savings accounts**: safe, accessible, but slow-growing.

The goal is finding a mix that keeps you both **financially on track** and **emotionally comfortable**.
