I am a strong believer in positive thinking and continuous personal and professional improvement. Starting my [Trader Gu Toolbox](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/HelloToolbox/) was a step toward that journey, and I firmly believe in setting clear, measurable short- and long-term goals. While long-term goals help me visualize what kind of trader I want to be, itâ€™s the short-term habits that drive me toward those goals.
Every day, I begin with a personal affirmation that reminds me of who I am and what I do. It literally takes 1 minute ðŸ˜†.

When it comes to trading, my affirmation is:
> I am a consistently profitable Forex day trader and Equity Swing Trader.
{: .prompt-tip }

> I'm not here to be right. I'm here to be profitable.
{: .prompt-tip }


## 2025 Measurable Goals

__Mindset & Discipline__
- [ ]  Maintain a >75% yearly average for my daily affirmation (tracked with Habit Tracker).

__Trading & Strategy__  
- [ ] Follow through on my [25 Year Trading Experiment](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/) with monthly investments on 22nd of each month.
- [ ] Limit Forex trades to max <2R risk per trade (avoid chasing the big wins!).
- [ ] Refine my equity risk strategy by developing a scalable model that adjusts to portfolio growth, transitioning from an invested capital approach to one based on current portfolio value.  

__Content & Community__
- [ ] Publish a minimum of 2 blog posts per month.
- [ ] Grow my x.com community to ~~100~~ 500 followers.


## Final Thoughts
These goals align with my long-term vision - building sustainable trading habits, refining my risk strategy, and growing a community of like-minded traders.

One thing you wonâ€™t see on this list? A financial goal. I believe that if I stay committed to my trading plan, follow my risk strategy, and continuously improve, the financial results will take care of themselves.
