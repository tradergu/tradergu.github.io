Time flies, and it's already 8 months into my 25 Year Trading Experiment. The past month has delivered outstanding results for my Actively Traded portfolio, and it's time for a monthly breakdown. 

All trades are always shared live on [X.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu), and the [public trading dashboard](https://dashboard.tradergu.com/) is always updated with the latest trade details and up-to-date portfolio allocations.

## Performance: Month to Month Overview
On a month-to-month perspective, the Actively Traded Portfolio has outperformed the Passively Invested Portfolio 5 out of 7 months, or 70% of the time. 

The Actively Traded Portfolio performance has been flat due to a significant drawdown on my new $NOVO trade, whereas the Passively Invested Portfolio has outperformed with a total of 1.6% gain.

## Realized P&L & Win Rate
Since inception, I have realized 13 trades:
- 🟢 7 Winners
- 🔴 3 Losses
- 🟡 3 Break-even (+- 3%) 

This translates to a 70% win rate when excluding break-even trades, or 58% including them. The top three trades percentage-wise have been $BABA, [$TSLA](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Trade-review-TSLA/) $OSCR, each delivering between 31% and 40% from entry to exit. Losses have been modest, with a maximum realized loss of just 7.2%.

## 25 Year Trading Experiment 
For a full overview of the experiment’s purpose and structure, check out my [First Post](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/) from January 2025, or watch the previously released [YouTube introduction](https://youtu.be/2dh3lpdWr7g).

**In short:**
* 💰 10,000 SEK (~$1000) invested monthly - split 50/50
* 🌊 Actively Traded vs  🌍 Passively Invested Global Index Fund
* 📅 Contributions on the 22nd of every month.
* 🕰 Tracking my performance from 2025 to 2050.
* 🌐 Transparency: Every trade shared publicly.

## Summary
September has been the best month since starting this experiment, and I was also able to exit my [best trade in terms of realized P&L on $ASML](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/trade-review-asml/) The portfolio is just closing in on a total of $10,000 with an aggregated portfolio performance year-to-date of 16.1%. But at the same time, I made some mistakes this month. I missed to enter a high conviction trade on $BIDU as well as messed it up on one of my trades for $INTC. In general, it actually could have been better, but in the end, I'm still very happy with the performance and the process of becoming a better trader on a day-to-day basis.
