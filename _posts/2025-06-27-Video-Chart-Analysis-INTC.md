$INTC (**Intel Corporation**) has been in a steady downtrend since 2021. Over the past year, price has been ranging in the mid-$20s â€” but this week, we just closed a **bullish market structure shift** on the weekly timeframe.

This could signal the early stages of a high-timeframe reversal.

In this video, I break down the price action and share what Iâ€™m looking for in a potential trade over the coming weeks.
