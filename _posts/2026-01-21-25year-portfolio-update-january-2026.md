We’ve finally made it. After 365 days, I’ve officially completed year one of my 25 Year Trading Experiment. The time went by faster than I expected, and I’m grateful for the consistency and discipline it took to see this first phase through. Now it’s time to break down the numbers - how things are shaping up so far, and what the trajectory could look like over the coming years if I continue to outperform the market.

All trades are always shared live on [X.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu), and the [public trading dashboard](https://dashboard.tradergu.com/) is updated with the latest trade details and up-to-date portfolio allocations.

## Realized P&L & Win Rate
Since inception, I have realized 14 trades:
- 🟢 8 Winners  
- 🔴 3 Losses  
- 🟡 3 Break-even (+/- 3%)

This translates to a 73% win rate when excluding break-even trades, or 62% including them. The top three trades, percentage-wise, have been $BABA, [$TSLA](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Trade-review-TSLA/), and [$OSCR](https://youtu.be/Q8yiuiuFkLQ), each delivering between 31% and 40% from entry to exit.  

Realized losses have so far been modest, with a maximum realized loss of just 7.2%. These results will change once I start realizing profit and loss for the open invalidated positions such as a massive drawback in a $NVO trade.

## Summary
I spend time on these monthly reviews for two main reasons.

First, they serve as a trading journal. Writing consistently helps me maintain a clear view of my long-term strategy, and reviewing progress on a monthly basis reinforces discipline and prevents me from drifting away from the broader objective. It’s a way to stay grounded, consistent, and continually remind myself that this approach is the right path forward.

Second, these updates allow me to share the journey publicly. By doing so, I create a layer of accountability that helps enforce my own process, while also offering transparency into what long-term, real-world trading actually looks like. If it inspires others to document their own journeys more openly and realistically, that’s an added bonus.
