## Realized P&L & Win Rate
Since inception, I have realized 13 trades:
- 🟢 8 Winners  
- 🔴 3 Losses  
- 🟡 3 Break-even (+/- 3%)

This translates to a 73% win rate when excluding break-even trades, or 62% including them. The top three trades, percentage-wise, have been $BABA, [$TSLA](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Trade-review-TSLA/), and [$OSCR](https://youtu.be/Q8yiuiuFkLQ), each delivering between 31% and 40% from entry to exit.  

Realized losses have so far been modest, with a maximum realized loss of just 7.2%. These results will change once I start realizing profit and loss for the open invalidated positions such as a massive drawback in a $NVO trade.

## Summary
A volatile month to say the least. Realizing good profits in $BRKR trade, 22% gain on position for a high conviction trade which might have been closed too soon. Time will tell and I walked through the trade in a recent [in-depth trade review](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/trade-review-brkr/).

However, my current high-conviction trades are showing a bearish market structure reversals on the weekly time frame and if that propagates to the monthly - realized losses will increase sharply coming months as $NOVO, $PYPL and $JD are currently putting pressure on my portfolio.

Cash position is strong, 30% with new monthly deposits on it's way. Looking forward I feel confident but humbled and try to always rememer the long-term goal of this experiment.
