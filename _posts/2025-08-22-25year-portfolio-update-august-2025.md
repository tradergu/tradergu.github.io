The summer has come to an end and it's been 7 months since starting my 25 Year Trading Experiment. Both the weather and the equity market have been volatile and it's time for the monthly portfolio update.

All trades are always shared live on [X.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu), and the [public trading dashboard](https://dashboard.tradergu.com/) is always updated with the latest trade details and up-to-date portfolio allocations.

## Performance: Month to Month Overview
On a month-to-month perspective, the Actively Traded Portfolio has outperformed the Passively Invested Portfolio 5 out of 7 months, or 70% of the time. 

The Actively Traded Portfolio performance has been flat due to a significant drawdown on my new $NOVO trade, whereas the Passively Invested Portfolio has outperformed with a total of 1.6% gain.

## 25 Year Trading Experiment 
For a full overview of the experiment’s purpose and structure, check out my [First Post](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/) from January 2025, or watch the previously released [YouTube introduction](https://youtu.be/2dh3lpdWr7g).


**In short:**
* 💰 10,000 SEK (~$1000) invested monthly - split 50/50
* 🌊 Actively Traded vs  🌍 Passively Invested Global Index Fund
* 📅 Contributions on the 22nd of every month.
* 🕰 Tracking my performance from 2025 to 2050.
* 🌐 Transparency: Every trade shared publicly.

## Summary
7 months and the portfolios are steadily growing month by month. The year-to-date performance has decreased slightly from the previous month. But it is quite fulfilling to see that it has been almost 70% green month so far. It will be interesting to see if I will be able to keep this performance going. As an outperforming 8% on a long-term basis would have a significant impact on the Actively Traded Portfolio.
