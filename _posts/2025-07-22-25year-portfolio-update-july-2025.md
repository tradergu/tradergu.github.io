It's the middle of the summer, and it's been 180 days since I started the 25 Year Trading Experiment. Much has happened in the past few months: the portfolio has increased, lessons learn and I'm thrilled sharing the July update

All trades are always shared live on [X.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu), and the [public trading dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCsMDJjEhU-OZyRrSXDfPYIgLufIaJ6GOod4ubMTBbI/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0) is always updated with the latest trade details and up-to-date portfolio allocations.

## Performance: Month to Month Overview
On a month-to-month perspective, the actively traded portfolio has outperformed the passively invested portfolio 4 out of 6 months. 

Although the first month was the best performer, the portfolio size was so small it barely made a dent in overall performance. The past three months have delivered a steady ~9% monthly portfolio increase.

The best trades percentage-wise have been $BABA, $CRSP, and $TSLA, each delivering between 19% and 40% from entry to exit. Losses have been modest, with a maximum loss of just 7.2%. Trade durations have ranged from 3 to 134 days.

## 25 Year Trading Experiment 
For a full overview of the experiment’s purpose and structure, check out my [First Post](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/) from January 2025, or watch the newly released [YouTube introduction](https://youtu.be/2dh3lpdWr7g).


**In short:**
* 💰 10,000 SEK (~$1000) invested monthly — split 50/50
* 🌊 Actively Traded vs  🌍 Passively Invested Global Index Fund
* 📅 Contributions on the 22nd of every month.
* 🕰 Tracking my performance from 2025 to 2050.
* 🌐 Transparency: Every trade shared publicly.

## Summary
Six months have flown by, and although it’s been a highly volatile first two quarters, I’m thrilled to see the passively invested portfolio out of its long-term drawdown and currently sitting at 🟢 +4.5%. Meanwhile, the global index remains in drawdown — highlighting how dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be a powerful strategy to benefit from volatility in both directions. If I had lump-sum invested all deposits into the passive portfolio at the beginning, it would still be in drawdown.

*Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)*

As for my trading performance, I’m still a bit disappointed in a few decisions (which I’ll walk through in an upcoming trade review), but overall, I’m satisfied. I’ve stuck to the strategy, executed consistently, and the actively traded portfolio is now showing meaningful profits.
