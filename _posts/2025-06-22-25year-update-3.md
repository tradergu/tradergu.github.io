It’s the end of Q2 2025, and 150 days into the 25-Year Trading Experiment. With plenty of market movement behind us, it’s time for the third portfolio update.

All trades are always shared live on [X.com/tradergu](https://x.com/trader_gu), and the [public trading dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCsMDJjEhU-OZyRrSXDfPYIgLufIaJ6GOod4ubMTBbI/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0) is always updated with the latest trade details and up to date portfolio allocations.

## Active vs Passive Portfolio
The actively managed portfolio has outperformed the passive benchmark by 💪 6.9 percentage points since inception.

* Actively Traded Portfolio: 🟢 +6.3% 
* Passively Invested Portfolio: 🔴 -0.6%

Looking at the month-to-month perspective, there has been volatility in both the actively traded and the passively invested global index fund. The monthly P&L has ranged from -10% to +17% for the active trade portfolio, while the global index has ranged from -9.4% to +8.1%, which is unusually volatile for global indices.

## 25 Year Trading Experiment 
For a full overview of the experiment's why and how, check out my [first post](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/25YearTradingExperiment/) from January 2025. 

**In short:  **
* 💰 10,000 SEK (~$1000) invested monthly — split 50/50
* 🌊 Actively Traded vs  🌍 Passively Invested Global Index Fund
* 📅 Contributions on the 22nd of every month.
* 🕰 Tracking my performance from 2025 to 2050.
* 🌐 Transparency: Every trade shared publicly.

## Summary
These past five months have flown by. I didn’t expect this experiment to influence my mindset so deeply, but trading publicly adds a unique layer of accountability.

There have been mistakes, but also a few big wins. One of the best parts of this journey has been sharing my process - from preparing trade reviews to writing these updates - and connecting with other traders on X.
