There are countless ways to trade — some focus on fundamentals, others rely on technicals. Some prefer the speed of scalping, while others take a swing trading approach. No two traders follow the exact same path, and more importantly, there’s no single "right" strategy for everyone.

Yet, if you spend any time in trading communities, you’ll find people eager to tear down others' strategies, criticize different approaches, and debate whose method is superior. I know this because I’ve caught myself doing it too.

It’s easy to look at another trader’s decisions and think, Why would they do that? That’s not how to trade! But over time, I’ve realized that this mindset does nothing to improve my own performance. Instead, it shifts focus away from what truly matters—refining my own system, mastering my psychology, and executing my edge consistently.

## The Psychology Behind It

Mark Douglas was a pioneer in trading psychology, best known for his books The Disciplined Trader and Trading in the Zone. His work emphasized that trading success is rooted in mindset, discipline, and emotional control rather than just technical skills or strategy. He helped traders recognize that their beliefs and attitudes shape their results, making self-awareness and adaptability essential for long-term profitability.

He was one of the greatest minds in trading psychology and a mentor from afar—though I never had the chance to meet him in person.

In *Trading in the Zone*, Douglas states:
> What's necessary, he says, is that the individual acquire the trader's mindset. It sounds easy, but the fact is, this mindset is very foreign when compared with the way our life experiences teach us to think about the world.

This resonates deeply. Our entire lives, we’re taught to compare, compete, and prove ourselves right. But in trading, that approach leads to frustration. Instead of critiquing others, I’ve learned to channel that energy into refining my own strategy, strengthening my discipline, and executing with confidence.

The market doesn’t reward opinions; it rewards discipline.


## The Danger of Criticism

When you focus on critiquing others, you divert mental energy away from what actually matters: your own trading performance.

* **You create unnecessary negativity** – Trading is already a mental challenge; why add more stress by fixating on others?
* **You ignore your own blind spots** – It’s easy to see flaws in others’ approaches while overlooking weaknesses in your own.
* **You reinforce a fixed mindset** – Growth comes from adaptation, not proving that one way is the only way.

I know this firsthand because I’ve been there. I’ve caught myself dismissing other traders’ approaches simply because they didn’t match my own. But over time, I’ve learned that every trader has their own journey. Instead of questioning why another trader’s strategy may not work, I now focus on why mine does—or doesn’t.

## What to Do Instead

Here’s what I remind myself when I feel the urge to critique others:

* **Analyze, Don’t Criticize** – If you see someone using an unconventional method, instead of judging, ask: What can I learn from this?
  
* **Stay Open-Minded** – No single system works in all market conditions. Adapt and refine your approach.
  
* **Measure Your Own Success** – Your P&L and consistency are the only metrics that matter. If you're profitable, why waste time worrying about someone else's trades?
  
* **Practice Self-Awareness** – If you feel compelled to criticize another trader, ask yourself why. Is it insecurity? Frustration? A need for validation?

## A Personal Example

Recently, the trading influencer [Dan Cheung asked on X](https://x.com/wannabechamp/status/1895942495026000178):

"What are some signs that show a trader is experienced?"

I replied simply:
"Doesn’t criticize other traders' strategy & decisions as one knows everyone needs their own path."

This is something I work on daily. There have been times when I’ve caught myself judging other traders' strategies, only to realize that doing so added zero value to my own progress.

Dan Cheung's thread was full of great insights from fellow traders, and reading through it reinforced an important lesson: the best traders focus on their own development instead of worrying about others.

## **Final Thoughts**

Successful trading is about managing yourself, not proving someone else wrong. Instead of engaging in strategy debates, focus on developing your own process, mindset, and discipline.

Every trader is on their own journey - respect that, and more importantly, respect your own.

I’m not perfect, and I still catch myself falling into old habits. But I’ve learned that when I shift my focus inward, my trading improves.
