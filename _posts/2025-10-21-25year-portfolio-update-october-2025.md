## Performance: Month to Month Overview
On a month-to-month basis, the Actively Traded Portfolio has outperformed the Passively Invested Portfolio in five out of nine months (roughly 55%). However, during the months it outperformed, gains were significant enough that the Actively Traded Account’s P&L is roughly three times higher.

For October, the Actively Traded Account was flat, while the MSCI ACWI Index gained 2.3%.

The total invested capital at risk is currently ⚠️ 17%, with the highest per-trade risk being 8% on $JD. Most recently, I’ve moved the stop loss for my $JD trade, resulting in 0% risk on the position.

## Realized P&L & Win Rate
Since inception, I have realized 13 trades:
- 🟢 7 Winners  
- 🔴 3 Losses  
- 🟡 3 Break-even (+/- 3%)

This translates to a 70% win rate when excluding break-even trades, or 58% including them. The top three trades, percentage-wise, have been $BABA, [$TSLA](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Trade-review-TSLA/), and $OSCR, each delivering between 31% and 40% from entry to exit.  

Losses have been modest, with a maximum realized loss of just 7.2%. These results will change once I start realizing profit and loss for the open positions—especially when $NOVO is invalidated and recorded as a loss, which I haven’t closed yet. The win rate would most likely be slightly lower.

## Summary
October has been quite volatile, with big moves in $PYPL, $NOVO, and $JD. My latest addition, $BRKR, and the most notable changes to the portfolio have been increasing risk in the $PYPL position—betting on more upside—and opening a new position in Bruker Corp.  

I also [posted a $BRKR chart analysis](https://youtu.be/ArGwsYaAGZM) and walkthrough on my YouTube channel.  

That said, I’ve made some mistakes. I failed to exit my $NOVO position, although I was very close—only a couple of percentage points from my exit level. Since then, we’ve had a big move to the downside, which I could have avoided if I had accepted the loss at the time. Now I’m still trapped and will evaluate what to do with that position in the coming weeks and months. It’s been bothering my performance lately.

I’m still heavy in cash, ready to take advantage of a potential larger market move to the downside. I’m not betting on it; I just don’t see many opportunities in the market right now, which is why I’ve built up a larger cash position.
