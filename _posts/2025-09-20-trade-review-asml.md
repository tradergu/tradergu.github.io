The semiconductor industry has been on tear to the upside in 2025. After previously posting a trade review for in terms of percentage P&L, I've now closed my biggest trade in terms of P&L on position on ASMLHere is my trade review of what I did well, what could be better, and how to improve for the future. 

Let's review the charts. 

### Long-Term Watchlist
I had followed the ASMLs and moved it to my high time frame watch list after we made a move and took out a significant monthly liquidity level. I was waiting for two opportunities to evolve:
1. A liquidity sweep followed by a move to the upside, which would confirm a bullish reversal pattern on the monthly time frame
2. Alternatively, that we would break down even further, seeking liquidity at the level from the 2023 low
I was ready for both.

### 🧲 Area of Interest
Price chose the first alternative, and we made a beautiful liquidity sweep followed by a confirmed bullish reversal pattern. The monthly candle closed above $740, leaving behind a bullish order block on the monthly time frame acting as a strong support and liquidity level for a high conviction move to the upside $746-$722. 

The target for this move was to re-test the bearish monthly order block and resistance level at $943-$970.

On the lower time frame, we had also made a clear bullish reversal pattern. On the weekly time frame, once we closed the weekly candle above $763 and had left behind a bullish weekly order block from $680 to $678 Which for me was a most interesting area to enter a position which would result in a strong risk-reward considering an exit point at $940.

### ✅ Trade Entry
I opened a position on a retracement to the monthly order block with an entry at $740, keeping a stop loss under the newly formed low at $620. I entered with half risk, anticipating we would have a further motive downside to the retesting of the weekly order block, which also happened. I added to my position at $688, whereas my averaged entry ended up as $720 on my main trading account.

**Trade Position**
📌 Entry: $711  
⛔️ SL: $37.15  
💰 Target: $132

### 🚨 Invalidated Level and Add-on Position

The original monthly order block was decisively invalidated - price broke through it and took out a significant area of liquidity. It reacted strongly at a **lower monthly order block**, aligning with the previous major lows from 2023.

Because I had anticipated volatility with a wide stop and saw a strong reaction at this new area of interest, I added to the position with a second aggressive entry at $85.34, keeping the same original stop loss.

My confidence came from the **bullish engulfing candle** forming the strong reaction. I entered on the retracement into a newly formed daily order block.

📌 Add-on: $85.34 (avg: $92.82)  
⛔️ SL: $37.15  
💰 Target: $132

### ✅ Confirmation for a High-Conviction Trade

After entering two positions with a wide stop loss - maximizing my defined risk per trade—I waited for a **weekly close or open above $109** to confirm a **bullish reversal pattern** and validate the setup as a high-conviction trade. 

Once we opened with strong bullish momentum above that level, I tightened the stop loss to the recent swing low at **$76.48**. My plan was to **add significantly to the position** on a retracement targeting **$98**, aligning with a **newly formed weekly bullish order block**.

📌 Entry (avg): $92.82  
⛔️ SL (tightened): $76.48  
💰 Target: $132

### 💰 Exit Position

Fortunately, I was already sized into the position because price never retraced to my add-on level. It moved quickly toward the target in the following weeks.

I exited at **$129**, just below of my $132 target, locking in a **🟢 +39% gain** on the full position.

## 🪞 Reflection

This trade was months in the making. I executed an aggressive entry at my **area of interest**, followed my **risk management plan**, and exited just below target - with no greed or hesitation.

One of the best trades of 2025 so far.

While I wish I had been able to **add more to the position**, I'm genuinely satisfied that I stayed in the trade, followed the plan, and closed it with a meaningful profit.

✅ Followed my strategy  
✅ Took full profit at target
