Most trading education glorifies day trading, scalping, and the "quit your job to trade full-time" dream. That approach never resonated with me.  

👋 I’m Gustav - engineer, entrepreneur, and part-time equity swing trader. My focus is on **high-timeframe swing trading** - trades that develop over weeks or months, not hours.  

This post is my way of showing how I make trading work alongside a busy life, and what you can learn from my strategy.

## Why Swing Trading Works for Me  

I don’t look at the 15m or 1h charts. My edge is built on the **weekly and monthly timeframes**, with the occasional daily chart for aggressive entries when price is already in my high-conviction zone.  

✅ Less screen time - prep on weekends or evenings  
✅ Clearer conviction - weekly/monthly structure filters noise  
✅ Quality over quantity - only high-conviction setups  

The **Friday close** and **Monday open** are key. They set the framework for the week and give me time to prepare calmly.

## My Trading Strategy in Short  

I trade using a **high-timeframe order block strategy**:  

1. **Find Areas of Interest (AOIs)**  
   - Weekly or monthly order blocks where institutions likely placed large orders.  
2. **Wait for Structure Confirmation**  
   - Bullish/bearish market structure shift around those levels.  
3. **Plan Entry**  
   - Aggressive entry if price taps AOI with confluence, or wait for confirmation on the daily chart.  
4. **Risk Management**  
   - SL always below the invalidation level of the order block.  
   - Position sized for max 1-2R risk.  

This way, every trade is either high conviction or not taken at all. I wrote more about this here: [🧰 Order Blocks for High-conviction Trading](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Order-blocks-trading/).

## Tools & Workflow  

- **Apple Watch Alerts ⌚️** - notify me when levels trigger  
- **Phone Execution 📱** - nearly all my trades are placed from my phone  
- **Trading Dashboard** - track risk and positions in one view  
- **Pre-Planned Orders** - limit entries & stops to remove stress  

This workflow keeps me consistent without sitting in front of screens.

## A Typical Trading Week  

- **Weekends** - full analysis, mark AOIs, prep scenarios  
- **Friday** - review weekly close  
- **Monday** - confirm weekly direction at open  
- **Daily** - quick pre-market check  
- **During workday** - rely on alerts, execute from phone if needed  

Example: My [📊 ASML trade review](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/trade-review-asml/) was built this way. I identified a monthly order block, confirmed the weekly structure, and executed directly from my phone. It turned into my biggest realized trade of 2025.

## Mindset  

The hardest part isn’t the strategy - it’s psychology.  

> I’m not here to be right.  
> I’m here to be profitable.  
{: .prompt-tip }  

That reminder keeps me focused on execution, not perfection.

## Final Thoughts  

Trading part-time while managing a career is absolutely possible.  

My recipe is simple:  
- Weekly/monthly structure for clarity  
- Order block AOIs for setups  
- Alerts + mobile execution for efficiency  
- Patience and risk management for consistency  

You don’t need to chase every move. You don’t need to quit your job.  

What you need is a **system that fits your life**. That’s what I’ve built - and what I share here to inspire you to build your own methodology.
