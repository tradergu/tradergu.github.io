Most trading education glorifies day trading, scalping, and the “quit your job to trade full-time” dream. That approach never resonated with me.  

👋 I’m Gustav - engineer, entrepreneur, and part-time equity swing trader. My focus is on **high-timeframe swing trading** - taking trades that develop over weeks or months, instead of staring at screens all day.  

This is how I’ve built a trading process that fits into a busy lifestyle, without sacrificing conviction or performance.

## Why Swing Trading Works for Me  

I don’t spend time on the 15-minute or 1-hour charts. Even the 4-hour chart rarely matters to me.  

My main analysis is on the **weekly and monthly timeframes**, with the occasional daily chart for aggressive entries when price is already in my high-conviction area of interest.  

✅ Less screen time - Prep in the mornings, evenings, or weekends.  
✅ Clearer conviction - HTF structures filter out noise.  
✅ Fewer, higher-quality trades – Patience over frequency.  

The **weekly candle close and new weekly open are critical**:  

- **Friday close** → confirms or invalidates structure.  
- **Monday open** → sets the tone for the coming week.  

This rhythm gives me time on weekends to reset levels and prepare.  

Much of this structure comes from my **Order Block methodology**, which I outlined here: [🧰 Order Blocks for High-conviction Trading](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Order-blocks-trading/)

## Tools That Keep Me Efficient  

Even though I don’t sit in front of charts all day, I stay connected with the right tools:  

- **Apple Watch Alerts ⌚️** - Triggered at my key levels.  
- **Phone Execution 📱** - I place nearly all trades directly from my phone.  
- **Google Sheets Dashboard** - My [trading dashboard](https://dashboard.tradergu.com/) keeps track of positions, risk, and performance.  
- **Pre-Planned Orders** - Limit entries + stops, so execution is automatic.  

This workflow keeps me disciplined — no micromanaging trades.

## A Typical Trading Week  

Here’s what my routine looks like:  

- **Weekends** - Deep analysis, mark AOIs, prep scenarios.  
- **Friday** - Weekly close is the most important candle.  
- **Monday** - Weekly open confirms or shifts bias.  
- **Daily pre-market check** - Quick check-in to see futures/pre-market direction.  
- **Market open trades** - If I want in, I don’t get greedy on entry. Better to be in from my phone than miss the move.  
- **During workday** - I rely on alerts. Execution is fast and mobile.  

A clear example? My [📊 ASML trade review](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/trade-review-asml/)  
I spotted the setup on monthly/weekly, planned levels, and executed entirely from my phone. It became my biggest realized trade of 2025.

## The Psychology of Part-Time Trading  

One of the hardest parts of trading isn’t strategy — it’s mindset.  

I’ve written about this in [Trapped by Perfection](/posts/Trapped-by-Perfection/), where I explored how perfectionism often creeps in after good trades.  

> I’m not here to be right.  
> I’m here to be profitable.  
{: .prompt-tip }  

That mindset keeps me from obsessing over intraday noise or missed entries.  

It also fuels my [📽️ 25 Year Trading Experiment](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/Video-25-Year-Trading-Experiment/) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} — a challenge to prove that consistent execution over decades can outperform the market.

## Sharing My Journey on YouTube  

Besides this blog, I also share **chart analysis videos** on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_d_z-SyYKSF6dR6atXvlw).  

Most recently, I broke down my trade thesis on **$JD**, walking through why I entered, my targets, and the market structure I was tracking. These videos let me expand on the exact setups I’m monitoring and how I manage them as a part-time trader.

## A Realistic Path for Busy Traders  

If you’re a busy professional, you don’t need to quit your job to succeed in trading.  

You need:  
- A **structured, repeatable process**  
- Patience for **high-conviction setups**  
- Tools that keep you efficient  

For me, that’s weekly & monthly swing trading. I may only take a few trades each quarter, but they’re deliberate, planned, and aligned with my system.

## Final Thoughts  

Trading part-time while managing a career is absolutely possible.  

You don’t need to chase every move. You don’t need to stare at screens all day.  

What you need is a **system that fits your life, not the other way around**.  

That’s what I’m building with Trader Gu 🌊 — the **Part-Time Trader’s Toolbox**: strategies, tools, and insights for high-conviction trading.
