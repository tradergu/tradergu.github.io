It’s been six months since my last update on the Main Trading Account, and it’s finally time for another portfolio review. With summer now behind us and five months left in 2025, I’m more excited than ever about the progress of my trading journey. While I continue to share a lot of content around my [25 Year Trading Experiment](https://www.tradergu.com/25-year-trading-experiment/), the Main Trading Account remains my primary focus when it comes to building long-term net worth.

## Performance: Year to Date

## Realized P&L
Since inception in October 2023, I’ve taken 23 trades, realizing P&L on 19 of them:
- 🟢 11 Winners  
- 🔴 4 Losses  
- 🟡 4 Break-even (±3%)  

This equates to a 73% win rate when excluding break-even trades, or 58% including them. I currently have 5 open trades, with the longest running since the end of 2023 for a total of 641 days. My top 5 trades have delivered returns ranging from 33% to 171%.

Worth mentioning is also that this year's P&L result is also heavily affected by the volatile $USDSEK development which has had a 🔴 16% move to the downside since beginning of 2025.

## Summary
The main trading account is in solid profits. While the additional deposits this year have lowered the year-to-date percentage gains, I remain confident in both the performance and the scale of this account going forward. Looking back since inception, it’s striking to see that I’ve taken only 23 trades over nearly three years - a reminder that strong results can be achieved by being selective with where you put your capital to work. That said, I do recognize that I’ve been over-trading in 2025. My focus now is on reducing the number of trades, only taking the highest-conviction setups, and staying disciplined with both my trading strategy and my [overall goals](https://www.tradergu.com/posts/2025-goals/) for the remainder of the year.

In addition, I’ve been considering switching my account base currency from SEK to USD to avoid currency exchange fluctuations impacting my P&L. If I decide to make the change, it will be implemented at the start of a new year.
